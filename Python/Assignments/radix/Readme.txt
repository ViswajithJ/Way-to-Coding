The radix_sort function takes a list of integers as input and sorts them in ascending order using the radix sort algorithm. It first finds the maximum number in the list to determine the number of digits needed for the largest number. It then loops through each digit position, starting from the least significant digit and moving towards the most significant digit. For each digit position, it creates 10 empty buckets (one for each possible digit), distributes the numbers into the buckets based on the current digit, and reassembles the numbers in order based on the current digit. It continues this process for each digit position until all digits have been sorted. Finally, it returns the sorted list.
